# Single Cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of pediatric Low Grade Gliomas (pLGG) and High Grade Gliomas (pHGG)

## Data Source: 
Alex' Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer - Single cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas (ScPCA) Portal

## Description
Assess biological variability between different pLGGs and pHGGs, and also the variability between pLGGs known to progress into pHGGs (Astrocytomas into Glioblastoma)

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data processing and integration
3. Data Normalization
4. Clustering and Cell Type Annotation
5. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
6. Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway Analysis
7. Interpretation
